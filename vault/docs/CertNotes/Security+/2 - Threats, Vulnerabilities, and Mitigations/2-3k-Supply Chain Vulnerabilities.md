## Supply chain risk
- The chain contains many moving parks
	- Raw materials, suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, customers, consumers
- Attackers can infect any step along the way
	- Infect different parts of the chain without suspicion
	- People trust their suppliers
- One exploit can infect the entire chain
	- There's a lot at stake
## Service providers
- You can control your own security posture
	- You can't always control a service provider
- Service providers often have access to internal services
	- An opportunity for the attacker
- Many different types of providers
	- Network, utility, office cleaning, payroll/accounting, cloud services, system administration, etc
- Consider ongoing security audits of all providers
