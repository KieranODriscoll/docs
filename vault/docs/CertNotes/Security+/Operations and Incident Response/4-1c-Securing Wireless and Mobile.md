# 4.1c - Securing Wireless and Mobile
## Site surveys
- Determine existing wireless landscape
	- Sample the existing wireless spectrum
- Identify existing access points
	- You may not control all of them
- Work around existing frequencies
	- Layout and plan for interference
- Plan for ongoing site surveys
	- Things will change
- Heat maps
	- Identify wireless signal strengths
## Wireless survey tools
- Signal coverage
- Potential interference
- Built-in tools
- 3rd-party tools
- Spectrum analyzer
## Mobile Device Management  (MDM)
- Manage company-owned and user-owned mobile devices
	- BYOD
- Centralized management of the mobile devices
	- Specialized functionality
- Set policies on apps, data, camera, etc
	- Control the remote device
	- The entire device or a "partition"
- Manage access control
	- Force screen locks and PINs on these single user devices
## BYOD
- Bring Your Own Device
	- Bring Your Own Technology
- Employee owns the device
	- Needs to meet the company's requirements
- Difficult to secure
	- It's both a home device and a work device
	- How is data protected?
	- What happens to the data when a device is sold or traded in?
## COPE
- Corporate owned, personally enabled
	- Company buys the device
	- Used as both a corporate device and a personal device
- Organization keeps full control of the device
	- Similar to company-owned laptops and desktops
	- Information is protected using corporate policies
	- Information can be deleted at anytime
- CYOD - Choose Your Own Device
	- Similar to COPE, but with the user's choice of device
## Cellular networks
- Mobile devices
	- "Cell" phones
	- 4G, 5G
- Separate land into "cells"
	- Antenna coverages a cell with certain frequencies
- Security concerns
	- Traffic monitoring
	- Location tracking
	- Worldwide access to a mobile device
- More secure than Wi-Fi or Bluetooth because they use encryption and authentication mechanisms to protect the data.
- Have a high bandwidth and can support a large number of devices at a time.
## Wi-fi
- Local network access
	- Local security problems
- Same security concerns as other Wi-Fi devices
- Data capture
	- Encrypt your data
- On-path attack
	- Modify and/or monitor data
- Denial of service
	- Frequency interference
## Bluetooth
- High speed communication over short distances
	- PAN (Personal Area Network)
- Connects out mobile devices
	- Smartphones
	- Tethering
	- Headsets and headphones
	- Health monitors
	- Automobile and phone integration
	- Smartwatches
	- External speakers
- Short-range radio waves
- Low bandwidth
- Not suitable for secure and reliable communication
