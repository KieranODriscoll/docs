## Threat Modelling
- Threat modelling is the process of reviewing, improving and testing the security protocols in place in an organization's IT infrastructure and services
- Critical stage of threat modelling process is identifying likely threats that an application or system may face, the vulnerabilities of the system or application may be vulnerable
- Threat modelling process principles:
	- Preparation
	- Identification
	- Mitigations
	- Review
- It is a process that needs constant review and discussion in order to be effective. An effective model includes:
	- Threat intelligence
	- Asset identification
	- Mitigation capabilities
	- Risk assessment
- Frameworks have been designed to help such as STRIDE
	- Spoofing
		- This principle requires you to authenticate requests and users accessing a system. Spoofing involves a malicious party falsely identifying themselves
		- Access keys, API keys or signatures via encryption help remediate this threat
	- Tampering
		- Providing anti-tampering measures to a system or application, you help provide integrity of the data. Data that is accessed must be kept integral and accurate
	- Repudiation
		- This principle dictates the user of services such as logging of activity for a system or application to track
	- Information Disclosure
		- Applications or services that handle information of multiple users need to be appropriately configured to only show information relevant to the owner
	- Denial of Service
		- Applications and services use up system resources, these two things should have measures in place so that abuse of the application/service won't result in bringing the whole system down
	- Elevation of Privilege
		- This is the worse-case scenario for an application or service. It means that a user was able to escalate their authorization to that of a higher level. Scenario often leads to further exploitation or information disclosure

## Incident Response
- Incidents are classified using a rating of urgency and impact. Urgency will be determined by the type of attack, and the impact determined by the affected system and what impact that has on business operations
- ![[Pasted image 20240516135740.png]]
- Incident is responded to by a Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT)
- The following 6 phases of incident response are followed to solve an incident
	- Preparation
		- Do we have the resources and plans in place to deal with incidents
	- Identification
		- Has the threat and the threat actor been correctly identified in order for us to respond
	- Containment
		- Can the threat/security incident be contained to prevent other systems or users from being impacted
	- Eradication
		- Remove the active threat
	- Recovery
		- Perform a full review of the impacted systems to return to business as usual operations
	- Lessons Learned
		- What can be learnt from the incident?
