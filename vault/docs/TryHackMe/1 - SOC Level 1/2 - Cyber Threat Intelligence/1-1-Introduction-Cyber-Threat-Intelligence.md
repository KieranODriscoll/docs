# 1.1 - Introduction to Cyber Threat Intelligence
## Cyber Threat Intelligence
- Defined as evidence-based knowledge about adversaries including their indicators, tactics, motivations, and actionable advice against them
- Utilized to protect critical assets and inform cyber security teams and management business decisions
- **Data** - Discrete indicators associated with an adversary, such as IP, URLs, or hashes
- **Information** - A combination of multiple data points that answer questions such as "How many times have employees accessed \<site\> within the month"
- **Intelligence** - The correlation of data and information to extract patterns of actions based on contextual analysis
- Primary goal of CTI is to understand the relationship between your operational environment and your adversary and how to defend your environment against attacks
- Seek this goal by developing your cyber threat context by answering the following questions:
	- Who's attacking?
	- What are their motivations?
	- What are their capabilities?
	- What artifacts and IOCs should you look out for?
- Threat intelligence can be gathered from different sources in the following categories:
	- **Internal**
		- Corporate security events such as vulnerability assessments and incident response reports
		- Cyber awareness training reports
		- System logs and events
	- **Community**
		- Open web forums
		- Dark web communities for cybercriminals
	- **External**
		- Threat intel feeds (Commercial & Open-source)
		- Online marketplaces
		- Public sources including government data, publications, social media, financial and industrial assessments
### Threat Intelligence Classifications
- **Strategic Intel** - High-level intel that looks into the organization's threat landscape and maps out the risk areas based on trends, patterns and emerging threats that may impact business decisions
- **Technical Intel** - Looks into evidence and artefacts of attack used by an adversary. Incident Response teams can use this intel to create a baseline attack surface to analyze and develop defense mechanisms
- **Tactical Intel** - Assesses adversaries' tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). This intel can strengthen security controls and address vulnerabilities through real-time investigations
- **Operational Intel** - Looks into an adversary's specific motives and intent to perform an attack. Security teams may use this intel to understand the critical assets available in the organization (people, processes and technologies) that may be targeted
