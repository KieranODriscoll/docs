# 1.3 - Cables and Connectors
## Copper Cabling
- The importance of cable
	- Fundamental to network communication
		- Incredibly important foundation
	- Usually only get one good opportunity at building your cabling infrastructure
	- The vast majority of wireless communication uses cables
- Twisted Pair Copper Cabling
	- Balanced pair operations
		- two wires with equal and opposite signals
		- Transmit+, Transmit- / Receive+, Receive-
	- The twist keeps a single wire constantly moving away from the interference 
		- The opposite signals are compared on the other end
	- Pairs in the same cable have different twist rates
- Coaxial Cables
	- Two or more forms share a common axis
	- Thick outer insulation that prevents the signals from any interference
	- RG-6 used in television/digital cable
		- and high-speed internet over cable
		- Specifications
			- Coaxial cabling
			- Suitable for long-distance cable runs
			- Used for cable television, satellite television and cable modems
	- RG-59 used as patch cables
		- patch cables is the same as a straight through
		- not designed for long distances
		- Specification:
			- coaxial cabling
			- suitable for short-distance cable runs
			- Used for analog video and CCTV installations
- Twinaxial cables
	- Two inner conductors (twins)
	- Common on 10 Gigabit Ethernet SFP+ cables
		- Full duplex, five meters, low cost, low latency compared to twisted pair
- Unshielded and Shielded cable
	- UTP (Unshielded Twisted Pair)
	- No additional shielding
	- Features:
		- Twisted-pair copper cabling
		- Used in ethernet networks and telephone systems
		- Low cost and ease of installation
		- Not surrounded by any shielding that would provide protection against interference from outside sources
		- In Ethernet networks, installed with RJ45 connector types
- STP (Shielded Twisted Pair)
	- additional shielding protects against interference
	- Shield each pair and/or the overall cable
	- Requires the cable to be grounded
	- Reduces interference from cross talk and EMI
		- Protects against outside interference and eavesdropping
- Abbreviations
	- U = Unshielded, S = Braided shielding, F = foil shielding
- (Overall Cable) / (Individual pairs)TP
	- Braided shielding around the entire cable and foil around the pairs is S/FTP
	- Foil around the cable and no shielding around the pairs is F/UTP
