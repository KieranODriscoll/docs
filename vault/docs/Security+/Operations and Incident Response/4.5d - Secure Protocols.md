# Unencrypted network data
- Network traffic is important data
	- Everything must be protected
- Some protocols aren't encrypted
- Verify with a packet capture
	- View everything sent over the network
# Protocol selection
- Use a secure application protocol
	- Built-in encryption
- A secure protocol may not be available
	- This may be a deal-breaker
# Port selection
- Secure and insecure application connections may be available
	- It's common to run secure and insecure on different ports
- HTTP and HTTPS
	- Clear vs Encrypted web browsing
	- HTTP: Port 80
