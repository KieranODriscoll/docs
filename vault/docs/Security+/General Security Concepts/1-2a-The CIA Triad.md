- Confidentiality
	- Prevent disclosure of information to unauthorized individuals or systems
- Integrity
	- Messages can't be modified without detection
- Availability

- Digital signatures
	- Mathematical scheme to verify the integrity of data
- Certificates
	- Combine with a digital signature to verify an individual
- Non-repudiation
	- Provides proof of integrity, can be asserted to be genuine
## Availability
- Information is accessible to authorized users
	- Always at your fingertips
- Redundancy
	- Build services that will always be available
- Fault tolerance
	- System will continue to run, even when a failure occurs
- Patching
	- Stability
	- Close security holes
