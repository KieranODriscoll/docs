# Replay Attacks
- Useful information is transmitted over the network
	- A crafty hacker will take advantage of this
- Need access to the raw network data
	- Network tap, ARP poisoning
	- Malware on the victim computer
- The gathered information may help the attacker
	- Replay the data to appear as someone else
- This is not an on-path attacker
	- The actual replay doesn't require the original workstation
# Browser cookies and session IDs
- Cookies
	- Information stored on your computer by the browser
- Used for tracking, personalization, session management
	- Not executable, not generally a security risk
	- Unless someone gets access to them
- Could be considered a privacy risk
	- Lots of personal data in them
- Session IDs are often stored in the cookie
	- Maintains sessions across multiple browser sessions

	- Additional load on the web server (HTTPS)
	- Firefox extension: HTTPS Everywhere, Force-TLS
- Encrypt end-to-somewhere
	- At least avoid capture over a local wireless network
