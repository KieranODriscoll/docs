# Brute force
- The physical version
- Push through the obstruction

	- Check the windows, try the doors
- Attackers will try everything
	- You should be prepared for anything
# RFID cloning
- RFID is everywhere
	- Access badges, key fobs
	- Duplicators are on Amazon
	- The duplication process takes seconds
	- Read one card, copy to another
	- This is why we have MFA

- Vulnerabilities in RFID
	- Spoofing
	- Eavesdropping
	- RFID cloning
	- Data interception
	- Replay attack
	- DoS attack
# NFC Vulnerabilities
- Eavesdropping

- DoS atacks
# Environmental attacks
- Attack everything supporting the technology
	- The operating environment
- Power monitoring
- HVAC and humidity controls
	- Large data centers must be properly cooled
