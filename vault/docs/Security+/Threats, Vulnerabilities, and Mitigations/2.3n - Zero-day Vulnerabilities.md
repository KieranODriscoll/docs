# Vulnerabilities
- Many applications have vulnerabilities
	- We've just not found them yet
- Someone is working hard to find the next big vulnerability
	- The good guys share these with developers
- Attackers keep these yet-to-be-discovered holes to themselves
	- They want to use these vulnerabilities for personal gain
# Zero-day attacks
- Attackers search for unknown vulnerabilities
	- They create exploits against these vulnerabilities
- The vendor has no idea the vulnerability exists
	- They don't have a fix for an unknown problem
- Zero-day attacks
	- An attack without a patch or method of mitigation
	- A race to exploit the vulnerability or create a patch
	- Difficult to defend against
# Zero-day attacks in the wild
- April 2023 - Chrome
	- Memory corruption, sandbox escape
- May 2023 - Microsoft
	- Secure boot zero-day
	- Attacker can run UEFI-level self-signed code
- May 2023 - Apple iOS and iPadOS
	- Three zero-day patches
	- Sandbox escape, disclosure of sensitive information, arbitrary code execution
	- Active exploitations
