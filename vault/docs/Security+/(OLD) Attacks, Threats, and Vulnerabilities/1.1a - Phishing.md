- Social engineering with a touch of spoofing
- Often delivered by email, text, etc
- Emails pretending to be some that they aren't.
- Trying to get you to click a link to gather information for you
- Can't make the address bar look exactly like the original URL. Good indicator to see if it is a phish
- Always something that is slightly off, that gives it away. But got to keep your eyes open
- Never click a link inside your email, type it yourself
- Attackers use many different tricks to try and trick us into clicking the link
	- Typosquatting - url hijacking, having the url look very similar so that it is harder to spot
	- Prepending - add on to the beginning of the URL, https://pprofessormesser/com
	- Pretexting
		- Lying to get information
		- Creates a situation they control the details of in attempt to trick you
- ## Pharming
	- Phishing but sent to a larger group of individuals instead of a specific person (spearfishing)
	- An example of pharming is directing a legit website to a bogus one. This is done by poisoning DNS server or client vulnerabilities
	- Combine pharming with phising
		- Pharming - harvest large groups of people
		- Phishing - collect access credentials
	- Difficult for anti-malware software to stop, since everything seems legitimate to the user
	- If the link looks legit but brings to an incorrect site, relies on malicious DNS records, so this is pharming
- ## Types of Phishing techniques
	- ### Vishing
		- Voice phising
		- Done over the phone, spoofing the caller ID
		- Fake security checks, bank updates etc
		- Leads to you giving up personal information
	- ### Smsishing (SMS Phishing)
		- Spoofing is a problem here as well, spoofing the  number
		- Try to get you to click a link in the text
	- ### Spear phishing
		- is a targeted phishing attack, usually involves having inside information in order to make it more believable
		- Whaling is when the spear phishing attack targets a CEO, or other "large catch"
- ## Finding the best spot to phish
	- ### Reconnaissance
		- Gather information on the victim
		- Background information can be gathered from open source tools. Can gather information on individuals and corporations
		- Can use sites like Linkedin, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram or the corporate website
		- This allows the attacker to build a convincing pretext
			- Where you work, bank, recent financial transactions, friends and family, etc
