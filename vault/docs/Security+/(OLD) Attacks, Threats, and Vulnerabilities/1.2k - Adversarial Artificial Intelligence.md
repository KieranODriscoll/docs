- ## Machine Learning
	- Computers are getting smarter
		- Can identify patterns in data and improve their predictions
	- Require a lot of training data
	- In use every day
		- Stop spam
		- Recommend products from an online retailer
		- etc
- ## Poisoning the training data
	- Confuse the artificial intelligence (AI)
	- Attackers send modified training data that causes the AI to behave incorrectly
- ## Evasion attacks
	- The AI is only as good as the training
		- Attackers find the holes and limitations
	- An AI that knows what spam looks like can be fooled by a different approach
	- An AI that uses real-world information can release confidential information
		- AI can be fooled to reveal that data
- ## Securing the learning algorithm
	- Check the training data, cross check and verify
	- Constantly retrain with the new data, more data & better data
	- Train the AI with possible poisoning
		- What would the attacker try to do?
