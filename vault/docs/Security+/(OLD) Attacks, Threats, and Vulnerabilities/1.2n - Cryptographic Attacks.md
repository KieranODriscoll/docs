- ## Cryptographic attacks
	- You've encrypted data and sent it to another person
		- Is it really secure?
	- The attacker doesn't have the key
		- So they break the safe
	- Finding ways to undo the security
		- There are many potential cryptographic shortcomings
		- The problem is often the implementation
	- ### Birthday attack
		- In a class of 23, odds 2 students share a birthday is about 50%. 30 people is about 70%
		- In the digital world, this is a hash collision
			- A has collision is the same hash value for two different plaintexts
			- Find a collision through brute force
		- The attacker will generate multiple versions of plaintext to match the hashes
			- Protect yourself with a large hash output size
- ## Collisions
	- Hash digests are suppose to be unique. Different inputs should never have the same output
	- MD5 Hash has collisions
- ## Downgrade attack
	- Instead of using perfectly good encryption, use something that's not so great
		- Force the systems to downgrade their security
