# Qualitative Risk Assessment
- Identify significant risk factors
	- Ask opinions the significance
	- Display visually with traffic light grid or similar method
	- Quantitative risk assessment
- ARO (Annualized Rate of Occurrence)
	- How likely is it to occur?
- Asset Value  (AV)
	- The value of the asset to the organization
	- Includes the cost of the asset, the effect on company sales, potential regulatory fines, etc
- Exposure Factor (EF)
	- The percentage of the value lost due to an incident
	- Losing a quarter of the value is .25
	- Losing the entire asset is 1.0
- Single Loss Expectancy (SLE)
	- What is the monetary loss if a single event occurs
	- Asset Value (AV) x Exposure Factor (EF)
	- Laptop stolen = $1,000 (AV) x 1.0 (EF) = $1,000 (SLE)
- Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE)
	- ARO x SLE
	- Seven laptops stolen a year (ARO) x $1,000 (SLE) = $7,000 (ALE)
- The business impact can be more than monetary
	- Quantitative vs Qualitative
# Impact
- Life
- Property
	- The risk to buildings and assets
- Safety
	- Some environments are too dangerous to work
- Finance
	- The resulting financial cost
- Reputation
	- An event can cause status or character problems
# Likelihood and probability
- Risk likelihood
	- A qualitative measurement of risk
	- Rare, possible, almost certain, etc
- Risk probability
	- A quantitative measure of risk
	- A statistical measurement
	- Can be based on historical performance
- Often considered similar in scope
	- Can be used interchangeably in casual conversation
# Risk Appetite and Tolerance
- Risk appetite
	- A broad description of risk-taking deemed acceptable
	- The amount of accepted risk before taking any action to reduce that risk
	- Organization's willingness to take on risk in pursuit of its business objectives
	- It reflects the organization's strategic approach to risk and how much risk it is willing to undertake to achieve specific goals
- Risk appetite posture
	- Qualitative description for readiness to take risk
	- Conservative, neutral, expansionary
- Risk tolerance
	- An acceptable variance (usually larger) from the risk appetite
	- Extent to which an organization's ability to withstand potential losses or disruptions
- Risk appetite
	- A highway's speed limit
	- Government authorities set the speed limit
	- The limit is an acceptable balance between safety and convenience
- Risk tolerance
	- Drivers will be ticketed when the speed limit is violated
	- Ticketing usually occurs well above the posted limit
	- The tolerance can change with road conditions, weather, traffic, etc
# Risk register
- Every project has a plan, but also has risk
	- Identify and document the risk associated with each step
	- Apply possible solutions to the identified risks
	- Monitor the results
- Key risk indicators
	- Identify risk that could impact the organization
- Risk owners
	- Each indicator is assigned someone to manage the risk
- Risk threshold
	- The cost of mitigation is at least equal to the value gained by mitigation
