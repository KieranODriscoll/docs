# Security standards
- A formal definition for using security technologies and processes
	- Complete documentation reduces security risk
	- Everyone understands the expectations
- These may be written in-house
	- Your requirements may be unique
- Many standards available
	- ISO
	- NIST
# Password
- What makes a good password?
	- Every organization has their own requirements
	- Create a formal password complexity policy
- Define acceptable authentication methods
	- No local accounts, only LDAP to the AD database, etc
- Create policies for secure password resets
	- Avoid unauthorized resets and access
- Other password policies
	- Password change frequency, secure password storage requirements, password manage options, etc
# Access control
- How does an organization control access to data?
	- Determine which information, at what time
	- and under what circumstances
- Defines which access control types can be used
- Determine how a user gets access
	- Requires privilege documentation
- Document how access many be removed
	- Security issue, expiration, contract renewals, etc
# Physical security
- Rules and policies regarding physical security controls
	- Doors, building access, property security
- Granting physical acess
	- Different for employees vs visitors
- Define specific physical security systems
	- Electronic door locks, ongoing monitoring, motion detection, etc
- Additional security concerns
	- Mandatory escorts, off-boarding, etc
# Encryption
- Define specific standards for encrypting and securing data
	- All things cryptographic
	- Can include implementation standards
- Password storage
	- Methods and techniques
- Data encryption minimums
	- Algorithms for data in use, data in transit, data at rest
	- Will probably be different for each state
