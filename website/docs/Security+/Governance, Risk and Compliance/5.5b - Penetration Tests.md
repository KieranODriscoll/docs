# Physical Penetration Testing
- Operating system security can be circumvented by physical means
	- Modify the boot process
	- Boot from other media
	- Modify or replace OS files
	- Modify or replace OS files
- Physical security is key
	- Prevent access by unauthorized individuals
- Assess and test physical security
# Pentesting perspectives
- Offensive
	- Red team
	- Attacks the systems and looks for vulnerabilities to exploit
- Defensive
	- Blue team
	- Identify attacks in real-time
	- Prevent any unauthorized access
- Integrated
	- Create an ongoing process
	- Identify and patch exploitable systems and services
	- Test again
# Working knowledge
- How much do you know about the test?
	- Many different approaches
- Known environment
	- Full disclosure
	- Passwords, usernames and other information
- Partially known environment
	- A mix of known and unknown
	- Focus on certain systems and applications
	- Some information about the target systems but not all details are known
	- Still require a reconnaissance phase
- Unknown environment
	- The pentester knows nothing about the systems
	- "Blind" test
# Reconnaissance
- Need information before the attack
	- Can't rush blindly into battle
- Gathering a digital footprint
	- Learn everything you can
- Understand the security posture
	- Firewalls, security configurations
- Minimize the attack area
	- Focus on key systems
- Create a network map
	- Identify routers, networks, remote sites
## Passive Reconnaissance
- Learn as much as you can from open sources
	- There's a lots of information out there
	- Remarkably difficult to protect or identify
- Social media
- Corporate web stie
- Online forums, reddit
- Social engineering
- Dumpster diving
- Business organizations
## Active Reconnaissance
- Trying the doors
	- Maybe one is unlocked
- Visible on network traffic and logs
- Ping scans, port scans
- DNS queries
- OS scans, OS fingerprinting
- Service scans, version scans
