# Phishing Campaigns
- How many employees would click a link in a phishing email?
- Many companies will perform their own phishing campaign
	- Send a phishing email to your employees
- An automated process
	- Centralized reporting for incorrect clicks
	- Users can receive immediate feedback and security training
	- Some organizations will schedule in-person training
- Recognize a phishing attempt
	- Spelling and grammatical errors
	- Domain name and email inconsistencies
	- Unusual attachments
	- Request for personal information
- Respond to reported suspicious messages
	- Email filtering can get the worst offenders
	- Never click a link in an email
	- Never run an attachment from an email
	- All organizations should have a process for reporting phishing
# Anomalous behavior recognition
- Risky behavior
	- Modifying hosts files
	- Replacing a core OS file
	- Uploading sensitive files
- Unexpected behavior
	- Logon from another country
	- Increase in data transfer
- Unintentional behavior
	- Typing the wrong domain name
	- Misplacing USB drives
	- Misconfiguring security settings
# Reporting and monitoring
- Track and analyze security awareness metrics
	- Automated
	- Phishing click rates
	- Password manager adoption, MFA use, password sharing
- Initial
	- First occurrence is an opportunity for user training
	- Work towards avoiding the issue in the future
- Recurring
	- The value of long term monitoring
	- Identify high-frequency security issues
	- Help users with multiple occurrences
# Development
- Create a Security Awareness team
	- Determine roles for training, monitoring, policy creation, etc
- Establish a minimum awareness level
	- Information delivery (emails, posters, notices, training)
	- Depth of training based on job function
- Integrate compliance mandates
	- PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR, etc
- Define metrics
	- Assess the performance of security awareness programs
	- Make updates in lower-performing areas
# Execution
- Create the training material
	- Provided to users in different forms
- Document success measurements
	- How will we know the awareness is working
- Identify the stakeholders
	- Provide ongoing metrics and performance data
- Deploy the training materials
	- Classroom training, posters, weekly emails, etc
- Track user training efforts
	- Ongoing monitoring, usually with an automated reporting system
- Security awareness policies and procedures are put into operation, encompassing actions like user training, dissemination of awareness resources, and monitoring the efficacy of the awareness initiative
# Optimization
- Post-execution phase concentrating on refining and enhancing the security awareness programs based on outcomes and feedback, without direct involvement in its active implementation
# Feedback
- Involves gathering reactions and responses from users after the introduction of security policies, not necessarily involving active training or distribution of resources.
# Initiation
- Initial phase where potential security threats are recognized, but no policies or procedures have been formulated or implemented
