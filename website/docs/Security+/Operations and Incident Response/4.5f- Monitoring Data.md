	- Some files should NEVER change
- Monitor important operating system and application files
	- Identify when changes occur
- Windows - SFC (System File Checker)
- Linux - Tripwire
- Many host-based IPS options
# Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
- Where's your data?
	- SSN, credit cards, medical records
- Stop the data before the attackers get it
	- Data "leakage"
- So many sources, so many destinations
	- Often requires multiple solutions in different places
# DLP Systems
- On your computer
	- Data in use
	- Endpoint DLP
- On your network
	- Data in motion
- On your server
	- Data at rest

	- Local DLP agent handled USB blocking
- Ban was lifted in February 2010
	- Replaced with strict guidelines
# Cloud-based DLP
- Located between users and the Internet
	- Watch every byte of network traffic
	- No hardware, no software
- Blocked custom defined data strings
	- Unique data for your organization
- Manage access to URLs
	- Prevent file transfers to cloud storage
- Block viruses and malware
	- Anything traversing the network
# DLP and email
- Email continues to be the most critical risk vector
	- Inbound threats, outbound data loss
- Check every email inbound and outbound
