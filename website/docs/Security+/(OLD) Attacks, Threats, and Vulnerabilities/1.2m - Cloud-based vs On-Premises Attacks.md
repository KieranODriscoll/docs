- ## Attacks can happen anywhere
	- Two Categories for IT Security
		- The on-premises data is more secure
		- The cloud-based data is more secure
	- Cloud-based security is centralized and costs less
		- No dedicated hardware, no data center to secure
		- A 3rd party handles everything
	- On-premises puts the security burden on the client
		- Data-center security and infrastructure costs
	- Attackers want your data, don't care where it is
- ## On-premise security
	- <span style="color:green">Customize your security posture</span>
		- full control when everything is in-house
	- <span style="color:green">On-site IT team can manage security better</span>
		- the local team can ensure everything is secure
		- <span style="color:red">A local team can be expensive and difficult to staff</span>
	- <span style="color:green">Local team maintains uptime and availability</span>
		- System checks can occur at any time
		- No phone call for support
	- <span style="color:red">Security changes can take time</span>
		- New equipment, configurations, and additional costs
- ## Security in the cloud
	- <span style="color:green">Data is in a secure environment</span>
		- No physical access to the data center
		- <span style="color:red">Third-party may have access to the data</span>
	- <span style="color:green">Cloud providers are managing large-scale security</span>
		- Automated signature and security updates
		- <span style="color:red">Users must follow security best-practices</span>
	- <span style="color:green">Limited downtime</span>
		- Extensive fault-tolerance and 24/7/365 monitoring
	- <span style="color:green">Scalable security options</span>
		- One-click security deployments
		- <span style="color:red">This may not be as customizable as necessary</span>
