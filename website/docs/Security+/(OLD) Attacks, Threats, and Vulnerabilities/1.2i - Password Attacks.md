- ## Plaintext / Unencrypted Passwords
	- some applications store passwords in plaintext
	- Do not store passwords in plaintext
		- Anyone with access to the password file or database will have your credentials
- ## Hashing a password
	- Hashes represent data as a fixed-length string of text
	- Will not have a collision (hopefully)
		- Some hashing functions have the issue of collision. Where 2 or more inputs have the same output
	- One-way function
		- Impossible to recover the original message from the hash (typically)
		- Common way to store passwords
- ## Spraying Attack
	- Try to login with an incorrect password, eventually will be locked out
	- Attack an account with the top three passwords
		- if they don't work move on
	- Large number of accounts with a few commonly used passwords
- ## Brute force
	- Try every possible password combination until the hash is matched
	- Will probably take a long time
	- Online attacks
		- Keep trying the login process
		- Very slow
		- Most accounts will lockout after a number of failed attemps
	- Offline attacks
		- Obtain the list of users and hashes
		- Calculate a password hash, compare it to the stored hash
		- Large computational resource requirement
- ## Dictionary attacks
	- Use a dictionary to find common words
	- Many common wordlists available on the internet
	- Discover passwords for common words
- ## Rainbow tables
	- An optimized, pre-built set of hashes
		- saves time and storage space
		- Doesn't need to contain every hash
		- contains pre-calculated hash chains
	- Speed increase, especially with longer password lengths
	- Different tables for different hashing methods
- ## Adding Salt
	- Random data added to a password when hashing
	- Every user gets their own random salt, commonly stored with the password
	- Rainbow tables won't work with salted hashes
	- Slows things down for the brute force method
		- doesn't completely stop the reverse engineering
	- Each user gets a different random salt, so same password will be different hashes
	- Example: Password: admin Salt: 12Ab$32
		- Hash input: admin12Ab$32
