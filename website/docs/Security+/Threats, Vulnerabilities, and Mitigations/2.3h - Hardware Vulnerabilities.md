# Hardware Vulnerabilities
- We are surrounded by hardware devices
	- Many do not have an accessible operating system
- These devices are potential security issues
	- A perfect entry point for an attack
- Everything is connecting to the network
	- Light bulbs, garage doors, refrigerators, door locks
	- IoT is everywhere
- The security landscape has grown
	- Time to change your approach
# Firmware
- The software inside of the hardware
	- The "operating system" of the hardware device
- Vendors are the only ones who can fix their hardware
	- Assuming they know about the problem
	- And care to fix it
# End-of-life (EOL)
- Manufacturer stops selling the product
- May continue supporting the product
- Important for security patches and updates
- End of service life (EOSL)
	- Manufacturer stops selling a product
	- Support is no longer available for the product
	- No ongoing security patches or updates
	- May have a premium-cost support option
- Technology EOSL is a significant concern
	- Security patches are part of normal operation
# Legacy Platforms
- Some devices remain installed for a long time
	- Perhaps too long
- Legacy devices
	- Older operating systems, applications, middleware
- May be running end-of-life software
	- The risk needs to be compared to the return
- May require additional security protections
	- Additional firewall rules
	- ISP signatures for older operating systems
