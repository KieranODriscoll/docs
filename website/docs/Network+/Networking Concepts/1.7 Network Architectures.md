# Architectures
![[Pasted image 20240606145516.png]]
## Three-tier Architecture
- Core (Top)
	- The "center" of the network
	- Web servers, databases, applications
	- Many people need access to this
	- Responsible for routing the traffic
		- Into and out of the network
	- Is made up of routers that perform the routing
	- Can also have switches depending on the network architecture
		- Perform fast switching
	- Contains high-speed devices with full hardware redundancy
- Distribution (Middle)
	- Is the second tier
	- A midpoint between the core and the users
	- Communication between access switches
	- Manage the path to the end users
	- Responsible for filtering the traffic
		- Uses access control lists
	- Is the tier where network policies are defined
	- Can contain Layer 3 switches and firewall
	- Has hardware and network redundancy
	- Connect with the access switches using high-speed uplinks
	- Provide redundant interconnections with the switches that can also perform the layer 3 routing
- Access (Bottom)
	- Where the users connect
	- End stations, printers
	- Contains access switches that
		- Connect client systems
		- Connect servers
	- Is responsible for segregating the traffic to be sent to appropriate VLAN
	- Allow users to access network services
	- Receives the packets from the distribution tier, and then it further segregates the traffic to the appropriate segments on the network.
## SDN (Software Defined Networking)
- Implements abstraction through different layers in a network
- Allows you to control the network without worrying about the underlying technologies
- Works in the vendor-neutral model
	- Integrate technologies from any vendor
	- Removes the complexity in a large network
	- Does not use proprietary protocols
- Networking devices have different functional planes of operation
	- Data, control. and management planes
- Split the functions into separate logical units
	- Extended the functionality and management of a single device
	- Perfectly built for the cloud
- Infrastructure layer / Data plane
	- Process the network frames and packets
	- Forwarding, trunking, encrypting, NAT
	- Contains switches for managing the traffic
		- By using the network hardware devices
	- Gets the instructions from the Control Layer to handle the traffic
	- Is responsible for collecting network health statistics, such as:
		- Traffic
		- Errors
		- Usage
		- Logging
	- Shares health network statistics with control layer
	- Contains the physical networking devices that receive information from the control layer about where to move the data and then perform those movements
- Control Layer / Control Plane
	- Manages the actions of the data plane
	- Routing tables, session tables, NAT tables
	- Dynamic routing protocol updates
	- Is known to be the brain of the SDN
	- Manages network policies and traffic flow
	- Translates the instructions from the Application Layer
		- Processes the requests to the network devices
	- Is known to be the brain of the SDN
	- Manages network policies and traffic flow
	- Translates the instructions from the Application Layer
		- Processes the requests to the network devices
	- Uses the information from applications to decide how to route a data packet on the network and to make decisions about how traffic should be prioritized, how it should be secured, and where it should be forwarded to
- Application layer / Management plane
	- Configure and manage the device
	- Contains the business applications that connect to the network
	- Contains network devices:
		- Load balancers
		- Firewalls
		- Proxy servers
		- Intrusion Detection System
		- Intrusion Prevention System
	- Communicates with the Control Layer using APIs
	- Management Layer
		- Is responsible for network:
			- Configuration
			- Monitoring
			- Management
		- Uses various methods to configure the SDN controller
			- HTTP/HTTPS
			- SSH
			- API
		- Monitor traffic conditions, the status of the network, and allows network administrators to oversee the network and gain insight into its operations
	- Focuses on the communication requests or information about the network
## Spine and leaf architecture
- Each leaf switch connects to each spine switch
	- Each spine switch connects to each leaf switch
- Leaf switches do not connect to each other
	- Same for spine switches
- Top-of-rack switching
	- Each leaf is on the "top" of a physical network rack
	- May include a group of physical racks
- Advantages
	- Simple cabling, redundant, fast
- Disadvantages
	- Additional switches may be costly
- Offers many benefits, such as resiliency, performance, low latency, scalability, and adaptability
- Spine
	- Contains the high-speed switches
		- Provide high-throughput
		- Offer low latency
- Leaf
	- Are connected with the systems and servers
	- Has each switch connecting to all spine switches
- Top-of-rack Switching
	- Keeps the access or the leaf switches on top of the rack
	- Provides the advantage of low cabling
	- Restrict the cables within the rack
	- Requires each leaf switch to connect to the spine switches
		- Forms a full-mesh switch network
		- Does not require a leaf switch to connect to another leaf switch
- Backbone
	- Are high-speed switches that connect to the leaf switches
	- Does not directly connect with the servers or systems
	- Can connect to the network devices
	- Can have => 10G interfaces
	- Are implemented with redundancy
- Two-tier architecture, full mesh topology
## Traffic Flows
- Traffic flows within a data center
	- Important to know where traffic starts and ends
- ![[Pasted image 20240606150444.png]]
### East-west
- Traffic between devices in the same data center
- Relatively fast response times
- Traffic that is flowing within the network
- Occurs at the same layer in a network
- Can also be between:
	- Two physical devices
	- One physical and one virtualized
### North-south traffic
- Ingress/egress to an outside device
- A different security posture than east-west traffic
- Is the ingress or egress traffic
	- Movies in and out of data center
- Is filtered by the edge devices such as
	- Router
	- Firewall
- Southbound
	- Is the traffic entering a network
- Northbound
	- Is the traffic leaving a network

### SDN Data flows
- ![[Pasted image 20240606150421.png]]
### Network locations
- Branch office
	- A remote location
	- Client devices, printers, switch/router/firewall
	- Uses a distributed network approach
	- Locates some servers, such as authentication, at the branch office
	- Saves on bandwidth
- On-premises data center
	- Technology is located in-house
	- Requires power, cooling and ongoing monitoring
	- Uses a centralized network approach
	- Connects with branch office using any form of connectivity, such as leased lines
	- Provides centralized control of the infrastructure
- Colocation
	- Share a data center with others
	- Local oversight and monitoring
	- Requires the use of a third-party physical location for infrastructure
	- Is used due to space constraints

# Storage Area Networks
## SAN (Storage Area Network)
- Looks and feels like a local storage device
- Block-level access
- Very efficient reading and writing
- Requires a lot of bandwidth
	- May use an isolated network and high-speed network technologies
- SAN vs NAS
	- NAS is a single storage device that serves files over ethernet and is relatively inexpensive. Easier for home user or small businesses to setup
	- SAN is a tightly coupled network of multiple devices that is more expensive and complex to set up and manage. Better suited for large businesses
## Fiber Channel (FC)
- A specialized high-speed topology
	- Connect servers to storage
	- 2-, 4-, 8- and 16-gigabit per second rates
	- Supported over both fiber and copper
- Servers and storage connect to a Fibre Channel switch
	- Server (initiator) needs a FC interface
	- Storage (target) is commonly referenced by SCSI, SAS or SATA commands
## Fiber Channel over Ethernet (FCoE)
- Use Fiber Channel over an Ethernet network
	- No special networking hardware needed
	- Usually integrates with an existing Fiber Channel infrastructure
	- Not routable
- Characteristics
	- Takes advantages of copper cabling
	- Enables connectivity between servers and data storage devices
	- Does not require any specialized hardware
	- Does not require separate cabling infrastructure
## iSCSI
- Internet Small Computer Systems Interface
	- Send SCSI commands over an IP network
	- Created by IBM and Cisco, now an RFC standard
- Makes a remote disk look and operate like a local disk
	- Like fibre channel
- Can be managed quite well in software
	- Drivers available for many operating systems
	- No proprietary topologies or hardware needed
