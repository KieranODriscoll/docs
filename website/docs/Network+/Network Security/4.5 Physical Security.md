## Video Surveillance
- CCTV (Closed circuit television)
	- Can replace physical guards
- Camera properties are important
	- Focal length - Shorter is wider angle
	- Depth of field - How much is in focus
	- Illumination requirements - See in the dark
- Often many different cameras
	- Networked together and recorded over time
- Motion detection
	- Radio reflection or passive infrared
	- Useful in areas not often in use
## Asset Tracking Tags
- A record of every asset
	- Routers, switches, cables, fiber modules, CSU/DSUs, etc
- Financial records, audits, depreciation
	- Make/model, configuration, purchase data, location, etc
- Tag the asset
	- Barcode, RFID, visible tracking number
## Tamper detection
- You can't watch all of your equipment all of the time
	- Have your systems monitor themselves
- Hardware tampering
	- Case sensors, identify case removal
	- Alarm sent from BIOS
	- Firewalls, routers, etc
- Foil asset tags
	- Tamper notification
## Employee training
- One on one - personal training
- Posters and signs - High visibility
- Login message - These becomes invisible
- Intranet page - Always available
- Ongoing updates - Keep everyone on their toes
## Access control hardware
- Security hardware
	- Purpose-built technology
- Gates, locks, cameras, etc
	- Specialized hardware to handle specific security requirements
- Often networked
	- Real-time monitoring and control
	- Required for cameras and sensors
## Badge readers
- Electronic - Keyless, PIN
- No keys to lose - No locks to re-key
- Centrally managed - Immediate control
## Biometrics
- Biometric authentication
	- Fingerprint, iris, voiceprint
- Usually stored a mathematical  representation of your biometrics
	- Your actual fingerprint isn't usually saved
- Difficult to change
	- You can't change your password
	- You can't change your fingerprint
- Crossover Error Rate (CER)
	- Calculated by plotting the false acceptance rate (FAR) and false rejection rate (FRR)
	- The point where FAR and FRR meet is the CER
	- One with the lowest CER is the most accurate
## Access control vestibules
- All doors normally unlocked
	- Opening one door causes others to lock
- All doors normally locked
	- Unlocking one door prevents others from being unlocked
- One door open / other locked
	- When one is open, the other cannot be unlocked
- One a time, controlled groups
	- Managed control through an area
## Locking cabinets
- Data center hardware is usually managed by different groups
	- Responsibility with the owner
- Racks can be installed together - side-to-sides
- Enclosed cabinets with locks
	- Ventilation on front, back, top and bottom
## Smart lockers
- Safe and automated delivery and pickup
	- Save time and prevent theft
- Packages are delivered to a smart locker
	- Recipient is sent an email/text with instructions
	- Use a PIN or mobile app to unlock
- Fast, convenient, and secure
	- No missing packages, easy to track and stress-free
## Data destruction and media sanitization
- Disposal becomes a legal issue
	- Some information must not be destroyed
	- Consider offsite storage
- You don't want critical information in the trash
	- People really do dumpster dive
	- Recycling can be a security concern
	- Physically destroy the media
- Reuse the storage media
	- Sanitize the media for reuse
	- Ensure nothing is left behind
## Sanitizing media
- Factory reset
	- Delete data and return configuration to the default
	- The next user gets a fresh configuration
- Wipe data
	- Unrecoverable removal of data on a storage device
	- Usually overwrites the data storage locations
	- Useful when you need to reuse or continue using the media
