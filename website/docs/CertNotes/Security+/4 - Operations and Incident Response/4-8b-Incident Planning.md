# 4.8b - Incident Planning
## Exercising
 - Test yourselves before an actual event
	 - Scheduled update sessions
- Use well-define rules of engagement
	- Do not touch the production systems
- Very specific scenario
	- Limited time to run the event
- Evaluate response
	- Document and discuss
## Tabletop exercises
- Performing a full-scale disaster recovery drill can be costly
	- And time consuming
- Many of the logistics can be determined through analysis
	- You don't physically have to go through a disaster or drill
- Get key players together for a tabletop exercise
	- Talk through a simulated disaster
## Simulation
- Test with a simulated event
	- Phishing attack, password requests, data breaches
- Going phishing
	- Create a phishing email attack
	- Send to your actual user community
	- See who bites
- Test internal security
	- Did the phishing get past the filter
- Test the users
	- Who click?
	- Additional training may be required
## Root cause analysis
- Determine the ultimate cause of an incident
	- Find the root cause by asking "why"
- Create a set of conclusions regarding the incident
	- Backed up by the facts
- Don't get tunnel vision
	- There can be more than a single root cause
- Mistakes happen
	- The response to the mistake is the difference
## Threat hunting
- The constant game of cat and mouse
	- Find attacker before they find you
- Strategies are constantly changing
	- Firewalls get stronger, so phishing gets better
- Intelligence data is reactive
	- You can't see the attack until it happens
- Speed up the reaction time
	- Use technology to fight
