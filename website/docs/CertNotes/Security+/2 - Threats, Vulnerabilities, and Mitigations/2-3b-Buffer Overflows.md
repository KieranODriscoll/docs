# 2.3b - Buffer Overflows
## Buffer Overflows
- Overwrite a buffer of memory
	- Spills over into other memory areas
- Developers need to perform bounds checking
	- The attackers spend a lot of time looking for openings
- Not a simple exploit
	- Takes time to avoid crashing things
	- Takes time to make it do what you want
- A really useful buffer overflow is repeatable
	- Which means that a system can be compromised
