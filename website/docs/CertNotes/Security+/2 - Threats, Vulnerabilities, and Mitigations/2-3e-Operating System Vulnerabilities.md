# 2.3e - Operating System Vulnerabilities
## Operating Systems
- A foundational computing platform
	- Everyone has an operating system
	- This makes the OS a very big target
- Remarkably complex
	- Millions of lines of code
	- More code means more opportunities for a security issue
- The vulnerabilities are already in there
	- We've just not found them yet
## A month of OS Updates
- A normal month of Windows updates
	- Patch Tuesday - 2nd Tuesday of each month
	- Other companies have similar schedules
## Best practices for OS vulnerabilities
- Always update
	- Monthly or on-demand updates
	- It's a race between you and the attackers
- May require testing before deployment
	- A patch might break something else
- May require a reboot
	- Save all data
- Have all fallback plan
	- Where's that backup?
