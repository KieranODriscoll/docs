# 1.1 - Security Controls
## Security Controls
- Security risks are out there
	- Many different categories and types to consider
- Assets are also varied
	- Data, physical property, computer systems
- Prevent security events, minimize the impact, and limit the damage
	- security controls
## Control categories
### Technical controls
- Controls implemented using systems
- Operating system controls
- Firewalls, anti-virus
- Sometimes called logical security controls
- Executed by computer systems (instead of people)
- Encryption, IDSs, Firewalls
### Managerial Controls
- Administrative controls associated with security design and implementation
- Security policies, standard operating procedures
- Also known as administrative controls
- Focused on reducing the risk of security incidents
- Documented in written policies
- Organizational security policy, Risk assessments, Security awareness training
### Operational Controls
- Controls implemented by people instead of systems
- Security guards, awareness programs
- Focused on the day-to-day procedures of an organization
- Used to ensure that the equipment continues to work as specified
- Primarily implemented and executed by people
- Configuration management, System backups, patch management
### Physical Controls
- Limit physical access
- Guard shack
- Fences, lock
- Badge readers
- Controls designed to deter, detect and prevent unauthorized access, theft, damage or destruction of material assets
## Preventive control types
- Preventive
	- Block access to a resource
	- You shall not pass
- Prevent access
	- Firewall rules
	- Follow security policy
	- Guard shack checks all identification
	- Enable door locks
- Encryption, Firewalls, AV software
## Deterrent control types
- Deterrent
	- Discourage an intrusion attempt
	- Does not directly prevent access
- Make an attacker think twice
	- Application splash screens
	- Threat of demotion
	- Front reception desk
	- Posted warning signs
- Warning signs, Lightning, Fencing/Bollards
## Detective control types
- Detective
	- Identify and log in intrusion attempt
	- May not prevent access
- Find the issue
	- Collect and review system logs
	- Review login reports
	- Regularly patrol the property
	- Enable motion detectors
- Log monitoring, Security audits, CCTV, IDS, vulnerability scanning
## Corrective control types
- Corrective
	- Apply a control after an event has been detected
	- Reverse the impact of an event
	- Continue operating with minimal downtime
- Correct the problem
	- Restoring from backups can mitigate a ransomware infection
	- Create policies for reporting security issues
	- Contact law enforcement to manage criminal activity
	- Use a fire extinguisher
- Recovering data from backup copies
- Applying software updates and patches to fix vulnerabilities
- Developing and implementing IRPs to respond to and recover from security incidents
- Activating and executing DRPs to restore operations after a major incident
## Compensating control types
- Compensating
	- Control using other means
	- Existing controls aren't sufficient
	- May be temporary
- Prevent the exploitation of a weakness
	- Firewall blocks a specific application instead of patching the app
	- Implement a separation of duties
	- Require simultaneous guard duties
	- Generator used after power outage
- Backup power systems, MFA, Application sandboxing, Network segmentation
## Directive control types
- Directive
	- Direct a subject towards security compliance
	- A relatively weak security control
- Do this, please
	- Store all sensitive files in a protected folder
	- Create compliance policies and procedures
	- Train users on proper security policy
	- Post a sign for "Authorized Personnel Only"
## Managing Security Controls
- These are not inclusive lists
	- There are many categories of control
	- Some organizations will combine types
- There are multiple security controls for each category and type
	- Some security controls may exist in multiple types or categories
	- New security controls are created as systems and processes evolve
	- Your organization may use very different controls
