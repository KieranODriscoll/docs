	- Important for facial recognition
	- Avoid shadows and glare
## Sensors
- Infrared
	- Detects infrared radiation in both light and dark
	- Common in motion detectors
- Pressure
	- Detects a change in force - Floor and window sensors
- Microwave
	- Detects movement across large areas
- Ultrasonic
	- Send ultrasonic signals, receive reflected sound waves
	- Detect motion, collision detection, etc
